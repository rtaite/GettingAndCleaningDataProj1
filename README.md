# Getting and Cleaning Data Project 1
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to write an R script to analyze a set of activity data and then write out a
summarized tidy dataset based on the activity data.  
## Scripts
There is only one R script in this repo:  "run_analysis.R".  This script downloads the data and performs the analysis
on the data.  Finally, it saves a tidy data version of the original activity data grouped by subject and activity and summarized
by the mean of each observation variable.  The observation variables are based on standard deviation and mean.
## Output
The final tidy dataset after running my analysis with run_analysis.R is stored in TidyData.txt
## Codebook
The codebook Codebook.MD describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean
up the data
